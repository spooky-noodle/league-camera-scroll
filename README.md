# Welcome to Spooky Noodle's Camera-Scroll Script!

If you're reading this, I assume that means you're looking to boost your map awareness by quickly and easily checking in on your teammates, and you're in exactly the right place.

Now, people have been using AHK scripts in League for a decade, and the only ones who have received anything like a ban or warning are people cheesing inhuman combos. We're basically just remapping some of the keyboard shortcuts to a different key. With that being said...

### ⭐ !! WARNING !!

I can't guarantee the safety of your League account if you're using AHK scripts (such as this one) during your games. It seems REALLY unlikely that they'd ban someone for this, but use at your own discretion.

## How to Use

There are 2 versions of the script:

#### LOCK 

Scrolling holds down the associated Fkey, keeping the camera semi-locked on the target ally. Tapping or pressing the `Middle Mouse Button` releases the camera, but doesn't snap the camera back to your champion. 

#### FLICK
Scrolling just taps the associated Fkey, moving your camera to the target ally, but without holding in place over them. Tapping the `Middle Mouse Button` doesn't do anything special, beyond what you have it bound to in League.

Here's how you use the script in-game:

At the start of the game, hold `TAB` and drag your little profile to the middle of all the champions (if it's not there already.) This makes things a little more intuitive, since the script assumes you are the middle of the champion roster.

⭐ `Scroll Up/Down` to cycle the camera between ally champions

⭐ Press or hold `Space` to return the camera to your champion

⭐ Press or hold `Middle Mouse Button` to unlock the camera (LOCK version only)

⭐ Use `Ctrl + Alt + Middle Mouse Button` to exit the script (in an emergency)

And that's everything. Supreme map awareness is at your fingertips, summoner! Good luck, and have fun.
